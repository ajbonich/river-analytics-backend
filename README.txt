Objectives:

Seasonal Stats:
- Calendar of kayak runs and when they run - when to do what run when in the spring runoff
    - average date of peak for each run
        - deviation analysis of peak (cfs variance and date variance)
            - compare different runs to determine trends
            - is there a "normal" for different historic time periods (after a dam was built?)

- Compare peak runoff/length of runable season to:
    - Snow water equivalent 
    - average temperature

- Average day of peak
- Odds of peak being on a specific day
- Avererage of daily maxes for every day


Daily Look-up:
- Average historic flow for a specific day 
    - percentile compared to median
- daily min/max swings
    - time of day these happen?


Trip Planning:
- Average runnable period
- 

Tasks:
- Determine what gauges
- Create a call to get data from gauge
- Calculate the percentage runnable time for each day

Future:
- List region and runnable time
